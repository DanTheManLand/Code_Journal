Git command

git gives you a command list

You have to tell git to store file info and to update storage
To add a file to the repo:
	git add "file name" - This is preparation for a save point (highlight)
	git status - tells current state of repository
	git commit - makes commit/ save point
		Runs a new program
		press i for insert - allows you to make a note about the changes
			press esc for next command
		:write - saves it 
		:quit - exits 

Once repository in computer is updated, you need to push that to the git server



MacVim - Program for editing
	Same as on the terminal, just the full version of it.
